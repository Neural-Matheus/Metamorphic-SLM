# Selection of Language Models for Research in Metamorphic Testing

## Context

In the context of research focused on metamorphic testing applied to Large Language Models (LLMs), selecting models that support both black-box and white-box testing is essential. Smaller models are preferred due to their ease of training, comprehension, and analysis.

## Decisive Factors

- **Ease of Training and Comprehension**: Smaller models are easier to train and understand, enabling more detailed analysis.
- **Open-Source Availability**: Open-source models facilitate experiment replication and the application of metamorphic testing.
- **Architectural Diversity**: Selecting models with diverse architectures enriches the research, allowing for the evaluation of a variety of behaviors and responses.
- **Relevance in the Scientific Community**: Widely studied and documented models provide a solid foundation for research, with access to additional resources and references.
