And this is why I don't review things immediately. For a while it would cut off after a few minutes. Now it's a couple seconds. There was only a very short window of time that it worked without cutting off. So maybe I got a fluke because the reviews are great. When it works it's so great. So fast and blows nice cool air. In the video it's on full charge. I had just taken it off a full day of charge seconds before. So yeah, now it's a glorified flashlight. Booooo! It's not the battery life that is bad btw because the flashlight still works. The use of USB-C makes it powerful. It just has a crappy motor.
