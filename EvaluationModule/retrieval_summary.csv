fsa11,"It seems like the shade is too small for my car despite measuring windscreen and double checking the measurements in the specifications above. When going to my car of a morning, the shade has fallen down overnight, letting all the light and heat into my car which it's supposed to stop. My rear vision mirror is attached to the windscreen and seems to get in the way of fixing the shade in place too. A friend who was sitting in the passenger seat the first time I used the shade told me I'd been ripped off and even though I laughed, I felt the embarrassment of being tricked.
